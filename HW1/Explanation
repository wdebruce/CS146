HW1 Problem:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Hint: There are 3 well known ways to solve this problem!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:
My initial guess would just to use a nested loop to find all combinations of indices that add up to the target.
Then return those two indices.
