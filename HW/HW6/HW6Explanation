#Homework6 Explanation

I used a triple nested for loop to find the indices of the three sum elements that statisfied the requirements and
constraints of the assignment.
It is quite simple algorithm and approach to it, but it works. However, I did notice that my list also returns permutations of
the indices that satisfy the sum requirement. In further effort, I should eliminate this behavior from my code as to simply
return the possible combinations from the given array, in other words, once an index is used and appended to the mainList
it should not be used again in a different iteration of the loops.
