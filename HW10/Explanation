Problem to solve:
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-1000 <= TreeNode value <= 1000

Expected outcome:
Output: [[4],[3,8],[1,5,9]]
Explanation: 4 is the root, and the only node on its level. 3,8 are one level down, together. 
1,5,9, the leaf nodes, are next level down.

Input: TreeNode with value,left,right = None provided
Output: None
Explanation: If there are no nodes in the tree, you can just return None. 

-------------------------------------------------
My Solution:
Traverse the tree level by level.
Each level queue the nodes from the next level
Each level remove and process the values from each node in queue into a linkedList
Once finished from a level, add that list of values into a List of Lists (levelOrder)
Repeat until queue is empty.
