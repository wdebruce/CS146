 * Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
 * An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, 
 * typically using all the original letters exactly once.
 * Hint: There are 2 well-known ways to solve this problem!

I put Strings s and t into an array translating each character into their corresponding
order number in the alphabet such that a,b,c,...z corresponded to 0,1,2,...25.
Then I used counting sort to increment the frequency of each letter that appeared in the
given strings. Instead of outputting a sorted array of numbers, I simply compared the
counted arrays of s and t. If s and t had the same frequencies of letters, then I could
conclude that that t is an anagram of s.
