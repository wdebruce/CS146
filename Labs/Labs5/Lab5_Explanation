For Lab5 I recursively visited each node and determined whether or not it was a valid BST by comparing the value in the node
to the value of a minimum and maximum value of the subtree.
So the left subtree of the root should be in the range of negative infinity and root value and the rightsubtree of the root
should be between the root value and positive infinity.
And as I traverse the tree, the range of any given node will narrow and eventually return true or false of valid BST.
So its almost like going down a funnel.
